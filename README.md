## 🌍 What Is OpenQuests?

OpenQuests is a lightweight multiplayer strategy RPG where the world evolves daily.

Every day:
- You choose one action.
- The world processes all actions.
- Bosses or random events may appear.
- Clans rise — or fall.
- The history is written by your decisions.

No grinding.  
No real-time pressure.  
Just meaningful decisions in a living world.

## 🛡️ Core Gameplay Loop

Each day you may:

- 🌾 **Gather** resources for your clan  
- 🧭 **Explore** distant lands to trigger events
- ⚔️ **Attack** monsters/bosses, or rival clans  

Your results depend on:
- Dice rolls (with fortune modifiers)
- Location events (weather, invasions, blessings, curses)
- Clan bonuses
- Team work for boss fights

The world advances once per day.  
Then the story unfolds.

## 🏰 Clans

You will be part of a clan, you will use clan's resources and contribute your rewards to the clan.

Each clan has it's own homeland, unique daily resource bonus and growing legacy:
🔥 Emberwatch – Masters of gold and ambition (bonus gold)
🌲 Timberkeep – Keepers of forests and timber (bonus wood)
🌾 Sunherd – Providers of food and sustenance (bonus food)
🟣 Prismveil – Maintainers of natural balance (balance bonus)
⚫ Shardveil – Holders of arcane knowledge (mysterious bonus)

Clans can:
- Be defeated
- Dominate others
- Lose resources to invasions
- Rise through coordinated effort

## 🐉 Boss Events

When a boss appears:
- The world is warned.
- Players decide whether to join the assault.
- The fight resolves the next day.
- Victory requires class composition and minimum participation.
- Failure still grants experience — but the boss remains.

If undefeated, it vanishes… for now.
